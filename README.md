# File-Editing-Manipulation-Using-Python
Any type of file (.txt .doc .docx) could edited or modifyed using a python script on to the target file.

#In this project, a python script has been devised to edit or modify a file (Ex: .txt or .doc or .docx).

The operations which were handled on the source file are:

1. Creating a destination file (if target file is not available). 
2. Copying the whole file contents to target file. 
3. Copy only few specified lines from source file to destination file. 
4. Editing the source file with few corrections (Text Replacement).
5. Insert few additional lines of data on the source file at specified location(line). 


Neccessary input is obatined from the user to edit the file.
If the target file or estination file is not available, we can create the empty target file using "Option: 1"

#Suggestions:

- In this project, I have placed all the source files, destination files and python script in the same folder. 
If they were in different folders, while giving input from the console, SPECIFY the path.
- Creating the target file by option 1, creates an empty file in the same folder, where the script has been saved and executed. 
- Valid source and target files must be given
